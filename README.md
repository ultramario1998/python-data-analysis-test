# Overview

This is a program that analyzes the World Happiness report and displays some metrics. The dataset may be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021) It is also included in the codebase, licensed under Creative Commons.

I was interested to see how some of the more practical stats in this dataset -- such as GDP -- related to things such as corruption and generosity.

# Data Analysis Results

My questions were:

What is the correlation between GDP per capica and perception of corruption?

What is the correlation between life expectancy and generosity?

I was able to show that there was a correlation between perceptions of corruption and GDP per capita. I was not, however, able to show any correlation between generosity and life expectancy.

# Development Environment

I used Python and the pandas library to import and analyze my data.
